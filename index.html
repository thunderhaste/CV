  <p>Michael Lucarelli grew up in a musical family in Pittsburgh where from a young age he
    consistently sought out the unfamiliar and the obscure.</p>

  <p>After starting the viola at age nine, he dove into music full-heartedly exploring various cultures, genres and styles from age-old traditions to avant-garde; including Swedish folk, Indian, Arabic, rock and jazz. The combination of his unique
    global interests and love for the unfamiliar has led him to create a world through his music that combines acoustic and electric violins, the Swedish Nyckelharpa, and eclectically feeding them through loop stations. He continues to seek out
    innovative ways to keep these
    instruments alive through the diverse soundscapes he creates.</p>

  <p>Michael has worked with many established musicians including Neal Morse (Neal Morse Band),
    Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), and recently Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line for the CMA’s
    in 2018.</p>

  <p>Earning a Master’s degree from Berklee College of Music (2020), Michael stays active in his
    local and international music scene as a private instructor, a session musician, performer, composer, and arranger.</p>

  <p>Michael’s passion through teaching, performing and creating is to inspire all generations to be a
    part of a global community of music making, and to explore the roads untraveled.</p>
